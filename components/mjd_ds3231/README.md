# ESP32 MJD DS3231 Real Time Clock component
This is component based on ESP-IDF for the ESP32 hardware from Espressif.

The board is based on the DS3231 chip which are typically used as an RTC Real Time Clock.

Some can also be used as an accurate external 32KHz crystal oscillator for the ESP32 (but only if that pin has been exposed).

## Example ESP-IDF project

## Supported Products.
1. The blue rectangular large ZS042 DS3231 RTC Real Time Clock Module.
2. The black smaller model (with yellow capacitor) for Raspberry Pi RTC Real Time Clock Module.
3. The blue circular ChronoDot V2 PCB Real Time Clock Module.
